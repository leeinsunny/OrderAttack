 ## üçîIntroduction
 ---
Seniors are becoming increasingly marginalized and unable to adapt to the modern society that is becoming digital and unmanned, causing the digital information gap to widen. This information gap has a great influence on the daily and cultural lives of seniors.
 First, many restaurants in Korea have set up unmanned kiosks, making it difficult for seniors to live their daily lives. If seniors who are unfamiliar with kiosks use them to order, the ordering time will be longer. This fact, the people behind seniors are waiting for them, brings to seniors psychological pressure. Due to this situation, seniors may be reluctant to visit offline stores itself. 
 Second, seniors are having difficulty in cultural life using digital devices. The lack of information on how to book movies through mobile applications causes seniors to be unable to book the desired seats or to give up watching popular movies. This shows the phenomenon of depriving seniors of cultural opportunity just because they are inexperienced in using digital devices.
 Therefore, we planned a solution using smartphone applications to solve these problems and reduce the seniors' fear of using digital devices. This solution allows seniors to learn and practice functions such as kiosk ordering, movie booking, and bus reservation, and we introduced a reward system to increase their accomplishment  with these exercises.
